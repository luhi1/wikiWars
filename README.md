# wikiWars is a tool for playing against your friends in reaching a wikipedia page first.
This is for personal use at the moment, though a less individualized version may be made in the future.
# To install Wiki Wars:
1. Unzip Files
2. Run the executable (if you're a linux user, you got this champ!)
3. Got to localhost:8080 on your web browser to play the game.
