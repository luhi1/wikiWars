# wikiWars is a tool for playing against your friends in reaching a wikipedia page first.
This is for personal use at the moment, though a less individualized version may be made in the future.

This project was based off of [wiki-race](https://wiki-race.com/), adding our own gamemodes to the mix 
# To install Wiki Wars:
1. Unzip Files
2. Run the executable (linux users, we will be compiling an executabe for you in a future version)
3. Got to localhost:8080 on your web browser to play the game.
